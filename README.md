# Chakra Checkout UI

This repository houses the code for a Next.js application that (currently) is just a basic checkout UI built with React and Chakra UI. The cart in the checkout is reactive, so depending on the data provided, the pricing changes. In the future, I hope to integrate this frontend with the backend and allow for fake "order processing". The UI is fully responsive and works well on on mobile devices, desktops, and everything in between.
